This is an ecommerce page for a fictional boardgame company that I built during my freetime during my internship. I used NextJS with Typescript. The goal of this project was to learn more about React, NextJS, and Typescript.

The API used to retrieve the board games was: https://www.boardgameatlas.com/api/docs
